Data Analysis of Tilt and Orientation of Solar Panels
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the tilt and orientation of solar panels to optimize their performance. The analysis uses data collected from various solar panels, aiming to understand how different features impact the panel angle and overall efficiency. This work is part of the IBM SkillsBuild Internship.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Data
The dataset used in this project includes features related to solar panel tilt and orientation. It can be found in the data/raw/ directory.

Running the Analysis
Data Preprocessing

Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/preprocessing.py
Feature Engineering

Execute the feature engineering script to create relevant features:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/feature_engineering.py
Model Training and Evaluation

Train and evaluate the model using the following script:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/modeling.py
View Results

After running the model, review the results in the results/ directory. This includes performance metrics, feature importance, and visualizations.

Analysis
The analysis involves:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of data, identifying patterns, and visualizing relationships between features and the target variable.
Feature Importance: Using models such as Random Forest to determine the importance of various features.
Model Performance: Evaluating the performance of different models and selecting the best one based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² score.
